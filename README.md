# ZombieRunner

Play Game Link to be Added Here

This is the the code from creating a basic zombie FPS shooter game while following the [GameDev.tv Unity3D course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2). 

The rest of my code from that course can be found [here in my other repo](https://github.com/JemWritesCode/Unity3DTutorial). I separated this project so I can try out some things with Unity/Github.
